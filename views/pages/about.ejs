          My name is David Zheng. I am a web developer at Code Fellows. My background is in sports medicine; I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in athletic training from Michigan State University. I am also a Navy veteran; I was an avionics technician in a F/A-18 fighter jet squadron. Prior to Code Fellows, I worked at a Boeing manufacturing plant as an athletic trainer. I decided to try software development because I want to learn something new and challenging. My interest for coding grew from my love of learning different spoken languages. My past experiences as an athletic trainer can shape me into a better developer because of my passion for helping people

          Hi, my name is Kyungrae, and I am a web developer with a background in data analysis project management. So why am I coding? I wanted a career that is more challenging and dynamic, with realistic career opportunities. But at the same time, I wanted something that I could have fun doing and find worthwhile!

            I'm Steve Rokitka (aka Steve Rocketkar). Product designer, UI/UX designer, design-usability-content unicorn - however you'd like to say it, I've been building tools and experiences for over a decade. My career's always been a multidisciplinary one. I started out as a writer-editor, turned web designer, and rolled everything together with a liberal coating of usability research at Cornell University. I've gone deepest on mobile apps, search/catalog design and marketing site design, along with some great indie publishing, data visualization and brand/identity projects.
